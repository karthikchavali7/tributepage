    <h1>Apple's domination</h1>
    <p><h3>In the decade since the iPhone’s debut, Apple has sold an average of 120</h3><h3>million devices per year. Yet, 10 years and 1.2 billion device sales later,</h3><h3> today’s unveiling of the newest line of iPhones is the most anticipated</h3><h3>Apple product event since its initial release in 2007.</h3>

       <h3> More remarkable than the newest features or latest design is the fact that</h3> <h3>the iPhone has retained its dominate position in terms of mindshare, if not </h3><h3>market share, for so long. (Samsung usually ranks first in the latter</h3><h3>category.) “When you are a dominant player, you have to think longer term</h3> <h3>and trust the relationship between your brand and consumers,” says</h3><h3> Jamen Graves, a senior partner in Korn Ferry’s Technology practice. “You </h3><h3>have to avoid the trap of getting caught battling competitors on features.”</h3></p>
